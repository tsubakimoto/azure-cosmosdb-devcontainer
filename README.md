## Using this definition

**[Optional] Include any special setup requirements here. For example:**

While the definition itself works unmodified, you can select the version of **YOUR RUNTIME HERE** the container uses by updating the `VARIANT` arg in the included `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.

```json
"args": { "VARIANT": "buster" }
```

### Adding the definition to a project or codespace

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please see getting started information on [setting up](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) Remote-Containers or [creating a codespace](https://aka.ms/ghcs-open-codespace) using GitHub Codespaces.

2. Start VS Code and open your project folder or connect to a codespace.

3. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Add Development Container Configuration Files...** command for **Remote-Containers** or **Codespaces**.

   > **Note:** If needed, you can drag-and-drop the `.devcontainer` folder from this sub-folder in a locally cloned copy of this repository into the VS Code file explorer instead of using the command.

4. Select this definition. You may also need to select **Show All Definitions...** for it to appear.

5. Finally, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** or **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** to start using the definition.
